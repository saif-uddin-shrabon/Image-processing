# Image Filtering & Denoising - Learning Project 🎓

A hands-on learning project exploring advanced image processing techniques, noise reduction algorithms, and quality evaluation metrics using Python.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

This project was created to understand and implement:
- **Image Noise Simulation** - Different types of noise (Gaussian, Salt & Pepper, Poisson, etc.)
- **Advanced Filtering Algorithms** - 10+ denoising techniques from basic to state-of-the-art
- **Quality Assessment** - Comprehensive evaluation metrics (PSNR, SSIM, MSE, etc.)
- **Interactive Visualization** - Real-time web demo and Jupyter notebooks
- **Batch Processing** - Parallel image processing workflows

## 🛠️ What I Built

### Core Modules
- `src/noise_simulation.py` - Generate various noise types for testing
- `src/advanced_filters.py` - Implementation of 10+ filtering algorithms
- `src/evaluation_metrics.py` - Quality assessment and comparison tools
- `src/batch_processing.py` - Process multiple images efficiently

### Interactive Demos
- `comprehensive_image_filtering_demo.ipynb` - Step-by-step learning notebook
- `streamlit_demo.py` - Web interface for real-time experimentation
